# Facebook-Analysis-project

here in this project i am talking about facebook analysis and The Facebook stock data consists of the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock price.
Open: The opening price of the stock on that date.
High: The highest price of the stock on that date.
Low: The lowest price of the stock on that date.
Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of the stock on that date.
Volume: The number of shares traded on that date.

The Facebook stock data can be used to analyze the performance of the stock over time, to identify trends, and to make predictions about future price movements. The data can also be used to compare the performance of Facebook to other stocks or to the overall stock market.

python packages :
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplolib.pyplot
4) seaborn

my questions :
1) Make an overview about the data include checking about missing values or duplicates?
2) make a statistical summary that helps in the analysis?
3) Make EDA in the data?
4) Create a new column 'Profit' to store the profit when the stock opens?
5) Plot the distribution of the Open prices over time to see the stock's trend?
6) Plot the volume of trades over time to observe any significant changes in trading activity?
7)  make a plot to see the relationship between 'Open' and 'Close' prices for Facebook's stock?
8) Plot a Histogram of the profit?
9) make a plot called kedplot about Open prices distribution?
10) Make a plot called jointplot to see the Relationship between the 'High' prices and the 'Profit' values?
11) plot the relationship between the profit and the opening price of Facebook's stock?
12) plot the relationship between the profit and the closing price of Facebook's stock?
13) create a correlation matrix?
